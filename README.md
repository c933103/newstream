================

Newstream is a fundraising and donation management system, designed for news organisations and NGOs. It was created
thanks to funding from the `Google News Initiatitve (GNI) https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/`. It allows users
to perform one-off donations, or set up recurring payments to your organisation. The portal allows donors to manage
their subscrption, view past donations, and update their personal details.

The system runs as a standalone web application, idependent of your main web presence. This avoids compatibility
or security issues which may be found with donation plugins. The system is self-contained, and can be installed
by non-technical users, by following the documentation.
